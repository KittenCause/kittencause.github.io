On Sunday, July 17, Kitten Cause will be sponsoring a volleyball fundraiser for Sarah Shelton. Sarah is in need of life changing surgery due to her severe scoliosis. During the event there will be teams of three playing against each other at the Rotary Park in Kirksville, Missouri. This event will be held from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm when the winner will be announced. There will be a grand prize for the winning team. Kitten Cause will be selling homemade shirts at the event.

Sarah is truly an amazing child, you would have no idea that she is having such a difficult time, mentally and physically. When Kitten Cause met Sarah during the filming of a commercial to spread the word about this fundraiser she was a complete joy to be around. Kitten Cause was able to met her, her mother, her father, and her best friend. They were all so excited about the event and are so thankful for the help that they have received already.
